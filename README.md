# Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Introduction

Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) globally claims many lives anually. There are many risk factors that have to be considered like diabetes, high blood pressure,abnormal pulse rate, high cholestrol


## dataset information
1.   age: the age of the individual whose attributes are being considered
2.   Sex:
    *   0: Female
    *   1: Male
3. cp-Chest Pain Type:
    *   1: [typical angina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680106/#:~:text=Typical%20angina%20(TA)%20is%20defined,coronary%20artery%20disease%20(CAD).)
    *   2: [atypical angina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763472/)
    *   3: [non-anginal pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2255129/)
    *   4: asymptomatic

4. trestbps:normal resting blood-pressure  ( in Hg)
5. chol: serum cholestoral (in mg/dl)
6.  restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    * Value 0: normal
    * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
7. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
8. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
9. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
10. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

    * Value 2: flat
    * Value 3: downsloping
11. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
12. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
